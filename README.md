# trip.fy
Using APIs and webscraping to build a product

Group project where we proposed to build a product which would route you to your destination, tell you the weather and build a playlist for the user to
listen to while on the road. For this end, we integrated several APIs, namely:

- Google Maps API
- IPMA (Portuguese weather institute) API
- Spotify API

The product gets a route for the trip, builds several playlists for different road types and displays the weather on location.

As a collaborative project, everyone did some work on all areas of the project, but broadly this was the distribution:

- João Laureano: IPMA
- Edgar Azevedo: Google Maps
- João Graça: Spotify
